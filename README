Code Browser -like extension for Komodo Edit

Contributors:
See content/NST.js

PLEASE - UPDATE COMMENT IN content/NST.js, or I could miss your contribution
on ActiveState Community website! And I don't want to!

Since I'm too busy with my current work to update NST, please feel free to
update the code as you like, fix bugs, implement new features.

Then test it, e-mail me it works and I'll release it as new version
on ActiveState Community website.

You don't need to fork the project, if you need anything, like privileges,
just ask. I don't use GIT everyday, so I don't even know how to grant them,
but I'll find it out.

I would love NST to become community project. It's my "baby", but I can't
find time to develop it anymore. Maybe if I ever change my job to more
related with what NST does or how it works...

Thank you for all the support. Feel free to change this README too.

-- Notes --
-----------

Please don't change code formatting:
2 spaces for indentation, opening braces on the same line.

Or if you convinced 4 spaces indentation would look more
readable (well, we have bigger screens now) - change the indentation
globally in each file, let it be consistent at least.

Please document your changes using JSDoc syntax.

THANK YOU.
